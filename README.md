This repository contains the tasks assigned to me during my internship at OASIS INFOBYTE. The tasks cover various topics such as machine learning,and data analysis. Each task code is organized in a 'code' folder and dataset in 'dataset_oasis' folder. The code is written in Python and uses libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
